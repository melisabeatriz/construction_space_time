# CSS Art inspired by Theo van Doesburg
A small project using CSS, HTML (and just a bit of JS to make ~~my life easier~~ it more responsive)

I played a little bit with CSS animations and had a lot of fun developing this project.
Inspired by a painting of one of my favourite art movements of the 20th century.
Hovering over it will show more information, trigger some animations or apply some filters, depending on the part.

Explore it and have fun :)
